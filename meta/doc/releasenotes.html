                                            CLx and CZx have opposite signs since the wind's z_axis is pointing up and the stability's z-axis is pointing down;

                                    since these preliminary results tend to show that panel methods for flows around sails are limited to narrow upwind conditions,
                                    the sail module will not be developed any further on the short term with the effort focusing instead
                                    on the plane/hydrofoil module.
