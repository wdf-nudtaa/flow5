                            <li>moved the T.E. flaps from the plane and foil objects to the polars;

                            <li>modified the calculation of induced drag for triangular method for increased robustness in the handling of flaps; leads to a slight increase in the predicted value</li>
                            <li>removed the option to keep results from failed 3d viscous interpolations; this is to prevent mixing of valid an invalid results</li>
                            <li>removed the dynamic storage of 3d unit solutions to be compatible with flapped polars; the linear system is now solved at each new calculation</li>

                            <li>added AVL type controls to T12358 polars and restored them in T7 polars</li>
                            <li>merged the interfaces of T12358 and T7 polars</li>
                            <li>added an option to calculate viscous drag on the fly in 3d analyses using XFoil; will become active when flow5 goes open-source</li>

                                            CLx and CZx have opposite signs since the wind's z_axis is pointing up and the stability's z-axis is pointing down;

                                            existing polars will need to be recalculated;</li>
